  <h2 class='destination'>1. Changing of engine oil</h2>
  <div class='description'>AOil ensures that your engine is properly lubricated: it allows the pistons to slide smoothly in the engine cylinders hundreds of times per second. Without lubrication, the friction between metal parts would damage the engine in just a few minutes. The oil also continuously releases impurities contained in the engine circuit. That’s why it eventually becomes loaded with too much micro-residue, which alters its original physical properties (viscosity) and therefore its efficiency. In addition, oil is inevitably lost over time: most engines burn up part of their oil when they run. It is therefore necessary to check your engine oil level at regular intervals in order to top it up when needed. <a href='https://gh.totalenergies.com/our-business/lubricants/more-about-engine-oil/check-and-change-engine-oil' target='_blank'>Learn More</a>.

  <h2 class='destination'>2. Overhauling Engine</h2>
  <div class='description'>AA diesel engine, which is an internal combustion engine that uses heat to ignite fuel, has an average service life of about 10 years. Diesel engines deliver both power and a high level of performance. But wear and tear over time on the engine components can lead to mechanical problems and performance failure. As you start to notice problems occurring with your diesel engine, the best way to address them might be by getting an engine overhaul. This procedure involves taking apart the engine, identifying faulty parts and replacing them, cleaning all the engine components, and then rebuilding the engine. An overhaul can increase the performance, power, and longevity of your vehicle. Use this guide to help you decide when to have your diesel engine overhauled.
